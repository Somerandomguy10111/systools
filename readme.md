Development objective:
These functionalities would probably work best if at least some of them were bundled in a GUI.
Where you can select the devices with dropdown, then click a button to perform the action.

TODO: 
- test ipconfig systematically
- publish ipconfig as apt installable
- consider human readable ls -l, chmod module

## requirements

sudo apt-get install uuid-runtime
sudo apt-get install arch-install-scripts
